# WhatsApp Group Chat Analyzer

This repository contains a comprehensive tool for analyzing WhatsApp group chats. The project processes exported chat logs by cleaning and converting them into a structured CSV file, generates basic visualizations (e.g., heatmaps, user activity bar charts, top emoji usage, and word clouds), and performs advanced topic modeling using BERTopic. Optional integration with OpenAIâ€™s ChatGPT or KeyBERT enhances text representation. Finally, all outputs are consolidated into an interactive HTML summary report.

## Main Feature

1. Configurable Processing: Easily adjust settings such as chat language, group name, API keys, and file paths through a simple configuration file.

2. Robust Data Extraction: Automatically convert raw WhatsApp chat logs into a clean, structured CSV format by filtering out system messages and normalizing user names.

3. Comprehensive Visualizations: Generate a suite of visual outputs including heatmaps that show active days and hours, bar charts for user activity, top emoji usage charts, and word clouds.

- Activity Heatmap.
- Top Users Bar Chart.
- Emoji Usage Chart.
- Wordcloud.
- Topics Over Time.
- Topics Map (Intertopic Distance Map).
- Topic Pie Chart.
- Topic Hierarchy Diagram.
- Topic Bar Chart.

4. Advanced Topic Modeling: Leverage BERTopic to extract and visualize discussion themes over time, with optional support from ChatGPT or KeyBERT to enhance text representation.

5. Interactive HTML Report: Consolidate all analytics and visualizations into a single, user-friendly HTML report for an overview of group chat insights.

## Configuration
